# Python Useless App

## History
I wanted to learn how to read pressed keys with Python to
build a simple terminal game and bumped into this lib
called pynput (great name, by the way), that could not
only read the keys pressed, but control the keyboard.

That was incredible to me and all the possibilities came
true. But... if only my head wasn't full or worms...
So this application was created!

When you run, it politely tells you how useless really is
and executes the tasks with **ALL ITS POWERS**. Try it
before reading the explanation and inspirations for the
project, would you?

If you have python, you can build the executable with 
_pyinstaller_ and have fun.

## Why?
It's funny. Programming should be fun.

## Inspirations
Some engineer I saw on the internet who build a wooden box
with a switch on the top of it. Whenever the switch was
pulled, a tiny claw would come out of the box and push it
back.

That guy is a **_legend_**.

## Spoiler (or "Do I have to draw?")
You run the application. It closes itself. That's it.

I loved it.
